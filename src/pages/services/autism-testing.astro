  <h2>What is Autism Testing?</h2>
  <p>
    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong developmental difference that affects how individuals communicate, process information, and interact with the world. Our comprehensive autism testing provides accurate diagnosis and insights to help you understand yourself or your child better.
  </p>

  <h2>Who Should Get Tested?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Children showing signs of social communication differences or restricted interests</li>
    <li>Adolescents struggling with peer relationships or academic challenges</li>
    <li>Adults seeking answers about lifelong patterns of behavior and experience</li>
    <li>Individuals with a family history of autism</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to Expect</h2>
  <p>
    Our evaluation process is thorough and individualized. We use evidence-based assessments, clinical interviews, and collateral information from family members or educators to gather a complete picture. The process typically includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial intake and background history</li>
    <li>Standardized autism-focused assessments</li>
    <li>Cognitive and adaptive functioning evaluation</li>
    <li>Behavioral observation and analysis</li>
    <li>Detailed feedback session and comprehensive written report</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
  <p>
    Our team provides <strong>neurodivergent-affirming care</strong>, recognizing autism as a natural difference rather than a deficit. We believe in understanding how autism shows up uniquely in each person, taking into account gender differences, cultural factors, and individual strengths and challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you're seeking diagnosis, educational accommodations, or simply a better understanding of yourself, we're here to provide compassionate, expert evaluation and support.
