    question: "What is psychological testing?",
    answer: "Psychological testing is a series of paper-based or computer-based assessments administered to \
    assess factors such as cognitive, executive, and adaptive functioning. Typically completed in one 3-4 hour sitting, though learning assessments may take 5-6 hours."
  },
  {
    question: "Why get tested at Twilight Psychology?",
    answer: "We specialize in neuro-affirming care for those frustrated by long waitlists or those who haven't fit traditional diagnostic profiles (e.g., high-masking women or adults). We provide official, comprehensive diagnoses accepted by agencies, including PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance) profiles."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you accept Medicaid?",
    answer: "Yes. We are credentialed with Traditional Kentucky Medicaid, Aetna Better Health, Humana Healthy Horizons, UHC Community Plan, and Passport by Molina. We cannot accept Wellcare or out-of-state Medicaid."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cost for Autism or ADHD testing with insurance?",
    answer: "Costs depend on your specific insurance plan. While we bill for the intake and feedback sessions, tele-assessment coverage varies. You must confirm your benefits prior to your appointment; if denied, the full self-pay rate applies."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to receive a formal diagnosis?",
    answer: "Insurance timelines are often constrained by prior authorizations (1-2 weeks) and clinician availability. \
    For self-pay clients, we can frequently complete the entire intake, assessment, and feedback process within a single week, if paid in full."
  },
  {
    question: "Will insurance cover learning disability assessments?",
    answer: "Generally, no. Majority of the insurance plans view these as 'educational' and exclude them. \
    At Twilight, we bill testing for other concerns (like ADHD/Autism) to insurance,  if we determine they are necessary. \
    We charge a separate hourly rate for the educational components. We can determine if learning disability testing is necessary after the intake session."
  },
  {
    question: "Where are you located?",
    answer: "Our main office is in Lexington, KY. However, through Psypact, we provide remote psychological services in over 40 states across the U.S."
