  <h2>Welcome Back</h2>
  <p>
    We appreciate your continued trust in Twilight Psychology. This page contains helpful information and resources for our existing clients.
  </p>

  <h2>Scheduling Appointments</h2>
  <p>
    Regular clients can typically schedule follow-up appointments more quickly than new clients. Contact our office or log into your client portal to schedule your next appointment.
  </p>

  <h2>Client Portal</h2>
  <p>
    Returning clients have access to our secure client portal where you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Schedule and manage appointments</li>
    <li>View upcoming appointments</li>
    <li>Request prescription refills</li>
    <li>Message your clinician between sessions</li>
    <li>Access session notes and records</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prescription Refills & Medication Management</h2>
  <p>
    If you need to refill a prescription or discuss medication concerns, please reach out to your clinician. You can submit requests through our client portal or by contacting our office directly.
  </p>

  <h2>Extended Absences</h2>
  <p>
    If you need to take a break from therapy or will be unable to keep scheduled appointments, please notify us as soon as possible. We have policies to help minimize impact on your treatment continuity.
  </p>

  <h2>Continuing Care</h2>
  <p>
    If you're interested in continuing therapy, increasing frequency, or exploring new treatment approaches, we're happy to discuss your options. Your clinician can help determine what's best for your needs.
  </p>

  </p>
